**Blink Blocker: Machine Learning Could Be Fun**

When you heard about “Machine Learning”, what word immediately came to your mind? Mine is “complex”. I start to ponder, “Could I turn something complex into fun stuff?” I analyze what activities I did every day, cause it must be something fun so I would voluntarily do it every day. I realized that I could spend a few hours scrolling through Instagram and TikTok. Then, it raised another question, what feature on these apps implements Machine Learning and was capable to be remade in the time of eight days of development? Face filter, but did a face filter itself already fun? I wonder if it needs a sprinkle of tension so the user feels challenged and would try to play it over and over again. Thus, I decided to serve this machine learning application in the form of a face filter game.

Let me introduce you to Blink Blocker, a face filter game that utilizes Machine Learning for face detection, especially detecting the player's eyes. The app could detect an eye blink. It will challenge the player to hold their eye blink for a minute. If the player blinked before the time runs out, they lose. Otherwise, they win. Dare to try?
